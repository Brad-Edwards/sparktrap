# SparkTrap

Building the future of cloud-native security operations - a high-performance, AWS-native packet capture and analysis platform engineered for scale.

## Why SparkTrap?

Modern security operations need more than just packet capture - they need intelligent, scalable platforms that can process network traffic at cloud scale. SparkTrap combines:

- High-performance packet capture engine written in Rust
- Cloud-native architecture designed for AWS
- Modern development practices (CI/CD, comprehensive testing)
- Extensible plugin architecture
- Real-world security operations focus

## Architecture

SparkTrap is built on two core components:

### Capture Engine

- Written in Rust for maximum performance and memory safety
- Zero-copy packet processing
- State machine-driven session management
- Designed for cloud-scale deployment

### Control Plane

- Python-based management layer
- Native AWS integration
- Infrastructure as Code deployment
- Robust monitoring and operational tooling

## Project Status

Currently building the foundation for enterprise-grade packet capture and analysis. Follow along as we develop:

- High-performance capture engine
- Cloud-native deployment patterns
- Security automation interfaces
- Operational tooling and monitoring

## Development

This project embraces modern engineering practices:

- Comprehensive test coverage
- CI/CD automation
- Infrastructure as Code
- Security-first design
- Documentation as Code
